Lab Exercise 1

1. Calculate the gamma statistic for this phylogeny of homalopsid snakes from 
   Alfaro et al., 2008: snake.tre.
   
2. Given this gamma value, what would you conclude about the tempo of speciation in 
   this clade?
   
3. Given that the crown age of the snake radiation is 22 MY and the total richness of 
   the clade is 34 species, determine whether the observed gamma could be due to the 
   amount of incomplete sampling in the empirical tree. On the basis of the MCCR test 
   what can you conclude about the tempo of homalopsid snake diversification?
   
4. What is the birth rate and death rate of the homalopsid tree?

5. Find a time-calibrated phylogeny for a group that interests you (ideally with more 
   than 30 tips and fewer than 200). Do the following: (1) Describe the clade 
   (including a description of the number of tips in the tree and the total number of 
   species in the clades) and provide a reference or citation to the source. 
   (2) Fit a birthdeath model to this tree and report b and d. (3) Perform an MCCR test 
   and describe whether the gamma value is extreme or not given the level of sampling 
   in the tree.
